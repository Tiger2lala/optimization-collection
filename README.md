# My rudimentary collection of optimization algorithms

The only way to truly understand something is to go through the suffering of implementing it.

As a lot of research work involves adapting and creating optimization algorithms, here I am, trying out my own implementations of a collection of important algorithms.

Not going for any speed or elegance, just making sure I really understand the theory.
